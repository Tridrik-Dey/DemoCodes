# DemoCodes
Demo C sharp codes produced for ongoing project
For your review, I have shared code repositories on GitHub, which can be accessed via the
following link: GitHub Repository. While I am currently working on a project funded by INAIL, I
am unable to upload the code to my personal GitHub profile due to policy restrictions. However,
in preparation for this development, I have created demo miniature VR environments, including
a VR Kitchen and a Chemistry Lab, integrated with the WEART Haptic Device. Due to file size
limitations, I have only uploaded selected C# codes performing some functionalities and
screenshots for your review on GitHub.
